//By default, Tailwind will include a wide range of utility classes in its generated stylesheet, so by specifying the files that actually use those classes in the `content` array, you can significantly reduce the size of the generated CSS file. This can help improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of CSS that needs to be loaded and parsed by the browser.
